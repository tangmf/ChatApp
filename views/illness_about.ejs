        <h2 class="page-title">Depression</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3 class="sub-title">About</h3>
            <p>
                Depression is a common mental disorder and one of the main causes of disability.
                In 2021, there is an estimated 280 million people globally that are affected by depression, with a
                higher percentage of women being affected.
                This has increased from 264 million in year 2019.

            </p>

            <h3 class="sub-title">Characteristics</h3>
            <p>
                Some symptoms that one may experience during a depressive episode includes:
                <li>depressed mood (feeling of sadness, irritability, emptyness)</li>
                <li>loss of pleasure </li>
                <li>loss of interest in activities (previously liked as well)</li>
                <li>feelings of guilt</li>
                <li>low self worth</li>
                <li>disturbed sleep or appetite</li>
                <li>tiredness</li>
                <li>poor concentration</li>
                <li> hopelessness about the future</li>
                <li>thoughts about dying or suicide</li>
                for most of the day, nearly every day or for at least two weeks

                Some may express their mood changes in the form of bodily symptoms, like pain and fatigue.
                They may have multiple physical complaints with no apparent physical cause.

                These may be long-lasting or recurrent, substantially impairing one's ability to function at work or
                school and cope with daily activities.

                A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate or severe depending on the number and
                severity of the symptoms, as well as the impact on the individual's functioning.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">Measures</h3>
            <p>
                There are prevention programmes for both adults and children. Some programmes for adults include
                psychosocial assistance after
                disasters and conflicts. Some programmes for children include protection and psychological support
                following physical and sexual abuse. These programmes
                have shown to reduce depression.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some medical treatments include:
                <li>Mild to moderate: Treated with talking therapy, such as cognitive behaviour therapy or psychotherapy
                </li>
                <br>
                Moderate to severe:
                <li>Antidepressants can be an effective form of treatment but not the first line of treatment</li>
                <li>Should not be used to treat depression in children</li>
                <li>Not the first line of treatment in adolescents</li>

    <h2 class="page-title">Dementia</h2>
    <div class="content">  
        <h3 class="sub-title">About</h3>
        <p>
            Dementia is not a specific disease but is rather a general term for the impaired ability to remember,
            think, or make decisions that interferes with doing everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease is the
            most common type of dementia. Though dementia mostly affects older adults, it is not a part of normal aging.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-title">What are the most common types of dementia?</h3>
        <p>
            What are the most common types of dementia?
            <li>
                <b>Alzheimer's disease.</b> This is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of
                cases. It is
                caused by specific changes in the brain. The trademark symptom is trouble remembering recent events, such as
                a conversation
                that occurred minutes or hours ago, while difficulty remembering more distant memories occurs later in the
                disease.
                Other concerns like difficulty with walking or talking or personality changes also come later. Family
                history is the
                most important risk factor. Having a first-degree relative with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of
                developing
                it by 10 to 30 percent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Vascular dementia.</b> About 10 percent of dementia cases are linked to strokes or other issues with
                blood flow to the
                brain. Diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol are also risk factors. Symptoms vary depending on
                the area
                and size of the brain impacted. The disease progresses in a step-wise fashion, meaning symptoms will
                suddenly get worse
                as the individual gets more strokes or mini-strokes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Lewy body dementia.</b> In addition to more typical symptoms like memory loss, people with this form of
                dementia may
                have movement or balance problems like stiffness or trembling. Many people also experience changes in
                alertness
                including daytime sleepiness, confusion or staring spells. They may also have trouble sleeping at night or
                may experience
                visual hallucinations (seeing people, objects or shapes that are not actually there).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fronto-temporal dementia.</b> This type of dementia most often leads to changes in personality and
                behavior because of
                the part of the brain it affects. People with this condition may embarrass themselves or behave
                inappropriately. For
                instance, a previously cautious person may make offensive comments and neglect responsibilities at home or
                work.
                There may also be problems with language skills like speaking or understanding.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mixed dementia.</b> Sometimes more than one type of dementia is present in the brain at the same time,
                especially in
                people aged 80 and older. For example, a person may have Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. It is
                not always
                obvious that a person has mixed dementia since the symptoms of one type of dementia may be most prominent or
                may overlap
                with symptoms of another type. Disease progression may be faster than with one kind of dementia.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Reversible causes.</b> People who have dementia may have a reversible underlying cause such as side
                effect of
                medication, increased pressure in the brain, vitamin deficiency, and thyroid hormone imbalance. Medical
                providers should screen
                for reversible causes in patients who are concerning for dementia.
            </li>
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-title">Signs and symptoms of dementia</h3>
        <p>
            Because dementia is a general term, its symptoms can vary widely from person to person. People with dementia
            have
            problems with:
    
            <li>Memory</li>
            <li>Attention</li>
            <li>Communication</li>
            <li>Reasoning, judgment, and problem solving</li>
            <li>Visual perception beyond typical age-related changes in vision</li>
            Signs that may point to dementia include:
            <li>Getting lost in a familiar neighborhood</li>
            <li>Using unusual words to refer to familiar objects</li>
            <li>Forgetting the name of a close family member or friend</li>
            <li>Forgetting old memories</li>
            <li>Not being able to complete tasks independently</li>
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-title">What increases the risk for dementia?</h3>
        <p>
            <li><b>Age</b></li>
            The strongest known risk factor for dementia is increasing age, with most cases affecting those of 65 years and
            older
            <li><b>Family history</b></li>
            Those who have parents or siblings with dementia are more likely to develop dementia themselves.
            <li><b>Race/ethnicity</b></li>
            Older African Americans are twice more likely to have dementia than whites. Hispanics 1.5 times more likely to
            have
            dementia than whites.
            <li><b>Poor heart health</b></li>
            High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking increase the risk of dementia if not treated properly.
            <li><b>Traumatic brain injury</b></li>
            Head injuries can increase the risk of dementia, especially if they are severe or occur repeatedly.
        </p>
    
        <h3 class="sub-title">How is dementia treated?</h3>
        <p>
            Treatment of dementia depends on the underlying cause. Neurodegenerative dementias, like Alzheimer's disease,
            have no
            cure, though there are medications that can help protect the brain or manage symptoms such as anxiety or
            behavior
            changes. Research to develop more treatment options is ongoing.
            <br>
            Leading a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, healthy eating, and maintaining social contacts,
            decreases
            chances of developing chronic diseases and may reduce number of people with dementia.
